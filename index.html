          <p id = "aboutme">My name is Michael Brooks. I am currently a senior at Bartlett High School in Bartlett, Tennessee. I am originally from St. Louis, Missouri, where I lived for fourteen years. Well-rounded and bright, I have excelled through school all my life. After high school, I plan on attending the University of Memphis to pursue a degree in biomedical engineering. </p>

          <p>I love working, and I have held a couple jobs throughout high school. I have experience bussing tables at Side Porch Steak House, a local restaurant, as well as fry cooking. Aside from that, I helped run my own small lawn business, “Mow Bros”, where a friend and I took care of numerous yards in the Bartlett area. I also enjoy tutoring fellow students.

    		<div class="col-sm-9 p2">
          <p>Aside from academics, I also take part in many activities outside of school. I have been a three-year member of the baseball team. Throughout high school, I have also participated in National Honor Society, BETA Club, and Canstruction, where I am able to serve others. One of my favorite days is Sunday, where I meet with my youth group and worship God at St. Ann in Bartlett.
          </p>
  
          <p>I also participate in Boy Scouts, where I recently became an Eagle Scout. The organization has allowed me to enjoy the outdoors while getting to serve my community at the same time. Favorite activities of mine include playing video games, working out, going fishing, and making music on the guitar!

          <p>Ever since taking a foundations class my senior year, I have enjoyed designing websites. An amateur, I am still learning new skills in order to make my sights as functional and responsive as I can. Apart from being a class, it has become a hobby that I have fun taking part in. I hope to improve my skills in the future and continue to design websites. It is an impressive skill I hope to become fluent and proficient in as the future approaches.
